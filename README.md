Repository for practising coding. Most of the problems have been solved by me unless there is a source link mentioned in the description.
## A little bit about me
I am Rakshitaa Geetha Mohan. I am working as Systems Engineer in Caterpillar (managed by an agency) since July 2021. I am a budding self-driving, ADAS, robotics technology enthusiast. My current project at caterpillar deals with creating Collision Awareness features for Caterpillar Trucks. I code, create test cases for my feature, debug using C++. 
I have a Master's degree in Automotive Engineering from Clemson University (https://cuicar.com/). I started showing interest in Autonomous Driving Technology during this period and chose all my electives following my passion towards this advanced ever-growing field. I was also part of Deep Orange 12 Project(https://cuicardeeporange.com/project/deep-orange-12/) where I got the opportunity to work on an autonomous race car. 
I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli(https://www.nitt.edu/).
